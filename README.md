# Image Loading and Processing of Na√Øve Bees
Load, transform, and understand the images of honey bees and bumble bees in Python.

## Project Description
Can a machine distinguish between a honey bee and a bumble bee? Being able to identify bee species from images, while challenging, would allow researchers to collect field data quickly and effectively. In this Project, you will use the Python image library Pillow to load and manipulate image data. You'll learn common transformations of images and how to build them into a pipeline.

This project will walk through working with image data, building classifiers using traditional techniques, and leveraging the power of deep learning for computer vision.

## Project Tasks
- Import Python libraries
- Opening images with PIL
